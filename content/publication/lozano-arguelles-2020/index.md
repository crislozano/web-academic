abstract: Previous studies attest that early bilinguals can modify their perceptual
  identification according to the fine-grained phonetic detail of the language they
  believe they are hearing. Following Gonzales et al. (2019), we replicate the double
  phonemic boundary effect in late learners (LBs) using conceptual-based cueing. We
  administered a forced choice identification task to 169 native English adult learners
  of Spanish in two sessions. In both sessions, participants identified the same /b/-/p/
  voicing continuum, but language context was cued conceptually using the instructions.
  The data were analyzed using Bayesian multilevel regression. Learners categorized
  the continuum in a similar manner when they believed they were hearing English.
  However, when they believed they were hearing Spanish, \"voiceless\"responses increased
  as a function of L2 proficiency. This research demonstrates the double phonemic
  boundary effect can be conceptually cued in LBs and supports accounts positing selective
  activation of independent perception grammars in L2 learning.
