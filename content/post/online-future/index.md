The fifth pandemic semester is starting and I keep wondering how this situation is going to change higher education. I work at an institution where the tension between the administration and the students is clear although I'm not sure they are even aware of it. The administration wants to go back to Fall 2019, but the students have seen how things can be different and don't want that reality anymore. 

We, the professors, are in the middle of that tension. We are now suffering the consequences as we see enrollment plummet. Many students at institutions like CUNY were forced to start working at the beginning of the pandemic to take care of family members
