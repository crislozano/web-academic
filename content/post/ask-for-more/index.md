Some of you know that I've been thinking about starting making videos about bilingualism, teaching, academia, and some random rambling. Until I figure out how to create decent videos, I've decided that a blog would be an easier entry point to share some ideas with you. If you know me, you've probably received at some point an article or a podcast that made me think of you, or that I knew you would love. I actually heard today [in a podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7xu4GyWbpKJJvqrz8JVhrU?si=W7kVj48QRQyIOHvRUvCBqA) that sharing content with your people is a love language and this definitely resonates with me. But this is not what I wanted to tell you today.

The academic job market season is starting and I'm not telling you anything new if I say that this year is going to be the toughest ever. For those of you preparing for it, you probably have already read [The Professor is In](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553419420/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=crislozano-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0553419420&linkId=79bd4b2297140d2e1388509fa68714b8) (if you don't know it, stop reading here and go get that book), have prepared your materials, and maybe even have sent the first application. I am going to press the forward button until you get an offer (I know, in 2020/2021, this is going to be almost impossible, but bear with me because I think this is still important). When I got my job offer I thought I was done, I could finally breath, relax and finish my dissertation. Little did I know how stressful the negotiation process would be (or at least it was for me). 

I was lucky to have an [advisor](https://span-port.rutgers.edu/faculty/452-nuria-sagarra) with top negotiation skills who helped me navigate the process. I had attended workshops on negotiating academic jobs, but the real problem was my fear of asking for things. I am going to give you summary of the thoughts going through my head when I had to negotiate: "I don't know enough", "I'm asking for too much", "They'll think I'm an arrogant", "They'll rescind the offer", "Can someone else do this for me?". When the truth is... I had all the qualifications they were asking for and I went through a rigorous selection process. Why was it so hard to ensure that they would give me the appropriate conditions to conduct my research and teach efficiently? 

I received an email from the provost to schedule a phone call on February 13th and accepted the offer on March 4th. During those two weeks, I had trouble sleeping and focusing on writing my dissertation. This is why I'm writing this post, I wouldn't want you to go through the same struggle. For many Ph.D. students, this is the first time you are actually negotiating an offer and chances are that you have no clue what to do. And if you are a woman like me, you probably have a hard time asking for things. The good news is that you can train to get over this fear and if you are looking for a job, you should start practicing now. 

When I noticed negotiation was getting tricky, I did a quick search on negotiation books. One idea sticked with me: "If you never hear no, you are not asking enough" [Ask For It](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553384554/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=crislozano-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0553384554&linkId=9accfbfabe5250008244e2106ffa18af). However, I now realize that this behavior does not change overnight. You need to practice it and you can start as soon as you are done reading this. You will soon realize that 1. you will get a lot more things and 2. it is ok to hear no. Where do you start? I'll give you a couple of examples of what I've been doing:

- I've been buying second hand technology online and I have asked for a discount on every single item. Guess what, I've got the discount (or close) on all of them. I used to be afraid of asking for this and after doing it a few times, the fear has completely disappear.
- The other day I went to a bar with live music (I drove 1 hour to get there, that's how much I miss live music in these COVID times). When we finally got a table, it was isolated in a corner, far away from the music. I had noticed a couple were about to live, in a table much closer to the music. I asked the waitress whether we could wait a couple minutes and get the nicer table. She said no, but I felt happy for having tried. A couple minutes later she came and told us we could get the nicer table.
- I haven't done this one yet, but I found it interesting. Next time you go to a coffee shop/bar, ask whether you can have a 10% discount. Most likely you won't get it, and you will realized that you're still alive and nobody cares that you asked for it.

As for how my actual negotiation, I had read and been advised to do everything via email. However, the provost insisted on talking and was not giving me any details about the job other than the salary (no info on start up funds, research funds, nothing). I tried to get some information via email but after a week, he requested to talk on the phone again. I was petrified. I sat down with my advisor and we went through everything I should ask for and, most importantly, why I deserve it and how it would benefit the institution. I couldn't sleep the night before talking to him, I was picturing him getting outraged at me for asking for an expensive eye-tracker (I actually need it to continue my research). Well, none of this happened, he was very cordial, eager to get me to the university, took notes of everything I asked for. He got back to me a week later saying yes to everything I had asked for. This probably means that...I could have asked for more. In the meantime, I received another offer, which I also negotiated but I did not get the eye-tracker I was asking for. This second offer gave leverage for negotiating the first offer. I felt terrible saying no to them. 

For some of you this might be obvious, consider yourselves lucky! But for many of us, reaching the negotiation stage is nerve-wracking. So start practicing now and your future self will thank you.
